<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action<br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
<p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.</p>
