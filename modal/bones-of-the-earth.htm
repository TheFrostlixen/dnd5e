<p><em>6th-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.</p>
<p>If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.</p>
<p>If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.</p>
