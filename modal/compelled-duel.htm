<p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action<br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.</p>
<p>The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.</p>
