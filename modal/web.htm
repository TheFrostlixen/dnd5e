<p><em>2nd-level conjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>
<p>You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.</p>
<p>If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.</p>
<p>Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.</p>
<p>A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.</p>
<p>The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>
