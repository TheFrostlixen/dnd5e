<p><em>4th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br/>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br/>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)<br/>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</li>
<li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>
<li>Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>
<li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>
<li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
<li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>
</ul><p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p>
